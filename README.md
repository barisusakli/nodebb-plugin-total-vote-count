# Total Vote Count Plugin for NodeBB

By default, the topic list in NodeBB shows how many votes the initial topic got.
This plugin modifies this behaviour so that the counter shows the total of all posts in a topic.

This is heavily based on code @barisusakli published on [NodeBB Community Forum](https://community.nodebb.org/topic/17179/total-vote-count-on-topic-list/3) - just slightly modified and packaged into a plugin

## Installation

Just install via ACP plugins page, or manually using `npm` (or any other compatible package manager)

```bash
npm install nodebb-plugin-total-vote-count
```
